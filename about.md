# About this project

LC Labs has been exploring how to use emerging technologies to expand the use of digital materials since our launch in 2016. We quickly saw machine learning (ML), one branch of artificial intelligence (AI), as a potential way to [provide more metadata](https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/experimental-access/) and [connections](https://citizen-dj.labs.loc.gov/) between collection items and users.  [Experiments and research](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2023/11/why-experiment-machine-learning-at-the-library-of-congress/) have shown the risks and benefits of using AI in libraries, archives and museums (LAMs).
